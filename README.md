For a personal passion project I decided to try to automate the process of setting up a Tectonic puzzle myself. I made this project in my own 2D game engine, Amugen, you can find it as the submodule or through here: https://github.com/AdriaanMusschoot/Amugen.

## What is a tectonic, you might wonder?

A Tectonic Puzzle (also known as Suguru) is a logic-based number puzzle where you fill a grid divided into irregularly shaped regions. Each region needs to be filled with the numbers from 1 up to the number of cells in that region, so a 5-cell region will use 1 through 5, for example. The catch is that the same number canâ€™t appear in two cells that touch, even diagonally. Solving it requires a mix of logic, deduction, and pattern recognition, often starting with regions that have only one possible solution and gradually narrowing down options as you move through the grid. Feel free to take a look at this example below!
